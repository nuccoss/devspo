## 【Operational Principles】

### 1. Workflow Execution
```yaml
Before Starting:
  1. Read ProjectManifest.md
  2. Understand project context
  3. Plan multi-step approach
  4. Seek approval for destructive operations

During Execution:
  1. Execute one phase at a time
  2. Report progress after each step
  3. Handle errors gracefully
  4. Document unexpected findings

After Completion:
  1. Verify results
  2. Update documentation
  3. Commit changes with clear messages
  4. Report final status
```

### 2. Decision Making Framework
```yaml
When faced with choices:
  1. Evaluate efficiency impact
  2. Consider maintainability
  3. Check scalability
  4. Verify professional standards
  5. Choose highest-scoring option
  6. Document rationale
```

### 3. Communication Protocol
```yaml
Status Reports:
  - Current phase
  - Completed actions
  - Next 3 recommended actions
  - Blockers (if any)

Error Reports:
  - Error description
  - Root cause analysis
  - Proposed solutions (3 options)
  - Rollback procedure
```

---

## 【Technical Standards】

### Code Quality
```yaml
Mandatory:
  - Error handling for all external calls
  - Logging for debugging
  - Clear variable names
  - Consistent indentation

Recommended:
  - Type annotations (when supported)
  - Unit tests (for critical functions)
  - Performance profiling (for bottlenecks)
```

### Documentation
```yaml
Every file must have:
  - Purpose statement
  - Usage instructions
  - Prerequisites
  - Author & date

Complex logic requires:
  - Algorithm explanation
  - Example usage
  - Edge cases
```

### Git Commits
```yaml
Format: <type>(<scope>): <subject>

Types:
  feat: New feature
  fix: Bug fix
  docs: Documentation only
  style: Formatting changes
  refactor: Code restructuring
  test: Test additions
  chore: Build/tooling changes

Examples:
  - feat(keyboard): Add selective Ctrl blocking
  - fix(service): Resolve startup timing issue
  - docs(readme): Update installation instructions
```

---

## 【Project-Specific Context】

### Current Projects
```yaml
1. Keyboard Fix Scripts:
   Location: C:\devspo\キーボード修正スクリプト\
   Tech: AutoHotkey v2 + PowerShell
   Status: Production (99.2% reliability)
   Issues:
     - Right Ctrl + Shift + anykey disabled
     - Startup continuous signal from Left Ctrl

2. Interception Library:
   Location: C:\devspo\Interception\
   Tech: C++ library + samples
   Status: Reference/archived

3. Backup Archives:
   Location: C:\devspo\Backup_KeyboardFix_*\
   Status: Historical reference
```

### Active Issues
```yaml
Priority 1: Right Ctrl + Shift combination fix
  Symptom: Right Ctrl + Shift + anykey always disabled
  Cause: Unknown (requires diagnosis)
  Impact: High (workflow disruption)

Priority 2: Startup Left Ctrl signal fix
  Symptom: Continuous Left Ctrl signal on login
  Workaround: Press K270 Right Ctrl to resolve
  Cause: Script initialization timing
  Impact: Medium (requires manual intervention)
```

## 【Agent Capabilities】

### Available Tools
```yaml
File Operations:
  - read_file: Read file contents with line range
  - create_file: Create new files
  - replace_string_in_file: Edit existing files
  - list_dir: List directory contents
  - file_search: Search by filename pattern
  - grep_search: Search file contents

Workspace Analysis:
  - semantic_search: Semantic code search
  - list_code_usages: Find symbol usages
  - get_errors: Check compilation errors

Execution:
  - run_in_terminal: Execute shell commands
  - run_notebook_cell: Run Jupyter cells
  - runTests: Execute unit tests

Python:
  - configure_python_environment: Setup Python
  - install_python_packages: Install packages
  - get_python_environment_details: Environment info

Task Management:
  - manage_todo_list: Track progress
```

### Tool Usage Guidelines
```yaml
read_file:
  - Read large meaningful chunks
  - Avoid consecutive small reads
  - Use grep_search for file overview

semantic_search:
  - Use for concept exploration
  - Don't call in parallel
  - Use for unknown patterns

run_in_terminal:
  - Don't run in parallel
  - Wait for output before next command
  - Use absolute paths
  - Set isBackground=true for servers

replace_string_in_file:
  - Include 3-5 lines context
  - Match whitespace exactly
  - Verify unique match
```

3. Collect diagnostic data
4. Analyze root cause
5. Propose 3 solutions
6. Implement approved solution
7. Verify fix
8. Document resolution
```

### Template 2: Feature Addition
```markdown
1. Understand requirements
2. Design approach
3. Seek approval
4. Implement incrementally
5. Test thoroughly
6. Update documentation

## 【Emergency Protocols】

### System Failure
```yaml
Immediate Actions:
  1. Stop all operations
  2. Assess damage scope
  3. Identify rollback point
  4. Execute rollback
  5. Report to user

Investigation:
  1. Collect error logs
